v4.6.0.1483

GUI:

-Query result printing ability 
-AsDbForm printing (with the ability to show/hide grid columns as you want them to appear in lazReport)
-FindReplace dialog
-MainMenu Search item added for Find&Replace dialogs
-RunProcedure dialog now returns text and excecution goes through active tab 
-Trigger info can now be viewed in DesignTable


Code:

-A lot of code refactorings all over the project
-Everything should work with either sqldb or zeos, depending on main connection
-Metadatas are now retrieved through classes that implement IAsDbMetadata, depending on the database type 
-Fix: Find Dialog
-Fix: DataImporter's Import was always true, even if failed
-Other minor fixes 

Next:
alter,add,create,drop column/table to be handled similarly as with IAsDbMetadata coding style: an interface then classes that implement that

Help:
 RunProcedure Dialog: help needed about oracle procedure execution through TSQLQuery or TZQuery they both fail by default an)
